Hej Jacob

Did you do anything related to chess app?

Hey,

I've been working with the files. The gbar IT finally downloaded mono,
but not the newest version, so I still had trouble with the Drawing and Threading includes. However, I just commented those out because I didn't see
them used anywhere.

However, I also had a problem with Evaluation.cs, because I couldn't find
where the 'Point' class was defined. Is this supposed to be the same as
the Move class from Move.cs? I tried changing all of the 'Point' to 
'Move', but still got some compiler errors related to class construction. 

Anyways, I've set aside some time tonight and tomorrow night to work on 
this project (most of the week I've been working on OS/ studying for exams).

For checkmate, we could build it in to the king_safe(). Basicially 
checkmate is when the king is in check and we can't make a legal
move. 

If we check king_safe() for every move in MoveGen, then all of the moves
will be guarenteed legal. Then if MoveGeneration returns an empty list 
we'll know we're in checkmate or stalemate. One last check of king_safe() would determine which.

I can implement the king_safe() into MoveGeneration tonight if you want.

Also, if you guys have Facebook maybe that would be easier for 
communication. Feel free to add me, just search Jacob Lambert Tennessee, 
first one, or jacob.lambert.7@faceboo.com might work.
