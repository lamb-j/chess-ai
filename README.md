# Chess Artificial Intelligence Engine

We developed a straightforward chess engine from scratch based on the alpha-beta algorithm. This required implementing a chess framework by encoding different chess pieces and their legal moves, and then implementing the alpha-beta algorithm for move generation. We developed the project using C# and Visual Studio.

## Context
This project was developed as a part of the Spring 2014 Artificial Intelligence in Computer Games (62526) course at Technical University of Denmark (DTU).
